### Contributions

The team divided Task 1 into subtasks as follows:
- Augusto worked on 1.1 
- Paul worked on 1.2 
- Niklas worked on 1.3
- Justus worked on 1.4

**Task 1 can be found here:** ../final-data-project-niklas-justus-paul/R/Task_1_Final

For Task 2, we worked collectively on the task. We decided on a research topic, formulated our question, and did exploratory analysis together. Augusto and Justus were responsible for wrangling the data and studying the demographic survey data. Paul and Niklas analyzed the political and media survey questions and wrote functions to use on the data. We collectively wrote the report.

### Data 

This repository comprises data from a survey conducted in the United States in 2018:

Guess, Andrew M.; Barberá, Pablo; Yang, JungHwan; Munzert, Simon (2022): *Media Exposure and Opinion Formation in an Age of Information Overload (MEOF) – Survey U.S.A.* GESIS Data Archive, Cologne. ZA7895 Data file Version 1.0.0, [doi:10.4232/1.13980](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13980).

In addition, it comprises associated passive browser tracking data, which is a subset of the data published here:

Munzert, Simon, Barberá, Pablo, Guess, Andrew M., & Yang, JungHwan (2022). *Media Exposure and Opinion Formation in an Age of Information Overload (MEOF) – Webtracking on-site.* GESIS, Cologne. ZA7896 Data file Version 1.0.0, [doi.org/10.4232/1.13981](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13981).

### Description

The Media Exposure and Opinion Formation (MEOF) study is a multi-wave panel survey that was fielded between April 2018 and October 2019 in the United States. It was branded as “Politics & Media” survey ([doi:10.4232/1.13980](https://doi.org/10.4232/1.13980)). The survey makes it possible to investigate political attitudes and behaviors, knowledge, online media consumption, and various issue attitudes of US citizens. In addition to survey data, the panel used passive metering technology to collect real-time data on web visits and mobile app use (not part of this publication). A similar survey was fielded in Germany as “Politik & Medien” Survey between June 2017 and October 2019 (see ZA7894, [doi.org/10.4232/1.13979](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.13979)).
